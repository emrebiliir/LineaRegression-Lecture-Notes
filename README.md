# Sales Prediction with Linear Regression


## I have developed a sales forecasting model. This model indicates the amount of sales obtained as a result of advertising expenses made on various channels. My first task is to build a simple regression model with two variables, and then proceed to build a model with all five variables present in the dataset.
